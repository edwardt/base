Meadow Note #101: Performance Experiments

* Message bus performance scaling
  In a single message bus, check if the performance of {X} scales as the
  number of devices attached to the bus increases.

* Distribute and collect
  Let n devices be in a given network. From a single device, ditribute the
  same query to all devices and collect its replies. Determine how long it 
  takes to get all replies.

* Roundtrip latency in a single message bus
  Let two devices be in a single message bus. Measure the roundtrip time 
  between service request and reply. 

* Roundtrip latency in distance-$n$ message buses
  Let two devices in two different message buses which are n-hops apart. 
  Measure the roundtrip time between service request and reply.
